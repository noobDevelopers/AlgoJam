## JOB SEQUENCING PROBLEMS
**Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and associated profit if the job is finished before the deadline. It is also given that every job takes single unit of time, so the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. How to maximize total profit if only one job can be scheduled at a time.**

A Simple Solution is to generate all subsets of given set of jobs and check individual subset for feasibility of jobs in that subset. Keep track of maximum profit among all feasible subsets. The time complexity of this solution is exponential.

This is a standard Greedy Algorithm problem.
